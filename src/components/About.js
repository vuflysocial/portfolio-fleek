            <p>
                Im a self taught Fullstack Web/Blockchain developer that has a great passion for react based projects . i use React daily and im currently working on an active react based blockchain project now . for about almost 2 years now i have been doing something i would consider to be freelance work. as a developer, im very eager to working with developers with more experience to help bring me to a higher level of operation through joined project ventres. However with the knowledge and creativity i do have i strongly believe i would be of a great fit/ team asset to have to any growing software company looking to higher energetic individuals who are self motivated and energetic about the art of development, as well as versed in live production deployments.
